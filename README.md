## üéØ Overview

This project implements an **AI-powered exercise form classifier and corrector** that provides real-time feedback on workout form quality. Using **Bidirectional LSTM networks** with **attention mechanisms** and **MediaPipe pose estimation**, the system analyzes two exercises:

- üèãÔ∏è **Bicep Curls** (Correct/Incorrect form)
- üí™ **Shoulder Press** (Correct/Incorrect form)

The application detects improper form, counts repetitions, provides coaching tips, and tracks workout statistics through an intuitive GUI.
